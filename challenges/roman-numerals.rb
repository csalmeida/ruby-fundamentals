# Challenge: Roman Numerals
# Create a data structure where each number maps to its respective roman numeral, from 0 up to 10.
# For instance, accessing numerals[5] should return 'IV'.
# Additionally, conditionals should evaluate correctly when applied.
# An example could be numerals[9] == 'IX' evaluating to true.
